Welcome! I'm a Data Scientist passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. With expertise in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization, I help organizations make data-driven decisions.

My work spans predictive modeling, natural language processing, and building scalable data pipelines. I believe in the power of clean, well-documented code and reproducible research.

When I'm not diving into datasets, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or capturing moments through photography.

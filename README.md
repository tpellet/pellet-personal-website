# Pellet.io - Minimalist Data Science Portfolio

## Overview

Pellet.io is a sleek, minimalist personal website showcasing your work as a Data Scientist. Built with Hugo (a fast static site generator), it deploys automatically via GitHub Pages with zero ongoing maintenance. The design emphasizes clean typography, generous whitespace, and subtle animations—professional without being corporate.

The site includes: (1) A landing page with your bio and key highlights, (2) A publications/articles page linking to your online writings, (3) A photo gallery page embedding a public Google Photos album (no backend needed—just an embedded iframe or Google Photos share link), (4) A resume section that auto-syncs with your curriculum_vitae_Thomas_Pellet.pdf from the Interviews repo (either via git submodule or a simple CI copy step), and (5) Links to your GitHub (thomas-pellet) and other professional profiles.

Low maintenance is achieved by: using Markdown for content updates, automatic deployment on push, Google Photos handling image hosting, and the resume PDF living in one canonical location. Success means a site you're proud to share that requires less than 5 minutes/month to maintain.
